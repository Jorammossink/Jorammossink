# About

I'm an energizer, a creative thinker, and an improver. My ambition is to make sure that you can do what you want to do, and do at your best. My gift to you, will be my best.

📈 In doing so I think the key to success is data. I believe that data is in the eye of the beholder [red. the definition of data doesn't necessarily exist on its own but is created by observers], data is not just there, data is made. Which means, with the right perspective, anyone can benefit from the use of data.
🛠️ Datamaker is here to help you grow that perspective; like a workshop for you and your business.
